 A 2d side scroller featuring original graphics and soundtrack. Its going to take a while to build.

This game builds upon my final project from Iron Yard (see SpaceGame). Its an ambitious project aiming to be a full side scrolling game with all aspects done personally.

Currently I have most of the core functionality developed for the combat parts of the game. I've created a system which allows me to quickly and dynamically create combat stages in a manner that allows me to "see" the level by looking at the code. I have a functioning design which now needs to be fine tuned and simplified. 

One of my goals is to make the enemies easily customizable rather than having each one hard coded. This makes it a little more complicated (at least while im trying to develop the model) but I think its good practice. I can pick an enemy preset or pick an enemy type and then load it with the weapons, load outs, textures and behavior I want.
